We started discussing drivetrains. We decided our drivetrain needs to be able to go over the blocker. We eliminated swerve drive immediately because it is too complicated and would likely have trouble. We settled on two main options, tank (with wheels or treads), and lifted mecanum. We also put some thought into “triples.” A system where wheels are minted in a triangle shape and when it hits an obstacle they rotate. This would allow us to easily cross the obstacle. We decided against it because of the complexity and inability to strafe. In the end, we decided to proceed with a lifted mecanum drive train and build a prototype.

We broke into two groups. One began prototyping a lifted mecanum chassis. The other began building a gobilda chais we won in a raffle. We prototyped half of the lifted chassis and discovered we were missing some parts. We ordered the missing parts.

\*From home, Sava and Govind were researching different intake designs\*

We finally received the missing parts for the lifted chassis. We finished building it. We found that because we mounted the motors in the middle of the robot it had to be extremely wide. We were hoping to build a chassis that could go both over and around the obstacles. Moving forward, we are starting to design a lifted chassis with the motors vertically over the wheels. We are hoping to complete the CAD in three days.
