**How to clone a repository**
Open iterm or terminal.
Navigate to your projects directory. 
Ls → allows you to see what directories you have
Cd → changes your directory
Open GitHub on a browser
Go to the repository you want to clone
Click the green code button
Copy the ssh code
Go back to your iterm or terminal window
Type in “git clone + the ssh key you copied”
It should say “Cloning into ‘the directory you indicated’ ...“
Then you are done! If it says you do not have access, see How to add an ssh key
