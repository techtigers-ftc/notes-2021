# How to use Programming Board

This is the programming KanBan board. It is automated so that pull requests to 
the `FtcRobotController2021` will show up in the *Review in Progress* category, 
to be reviewed by another person and then accepted. 
**For any changes to code, you now must submit a pull request for someone to review.**
