**Members Present:** Sava, Amulya, Rishab, Aadi, Alisha

**Notes:**
* started discussing drivetrains
* we decided that our robot should be able to go over the blocker
* if possible it should be narrow enough to go around as well
* investigating "triples" a system where wheels are mounted in atriangle shape
* investigeting lifting a mecanum chasis

**Blocking:**
* waiting on Gobilda kit
* REV expansion hub out of stock


# 2021-09-22

**Members Present:** Sava, Amulya, Govind, Aadi

**Notes:**
* continueing work on lifted mecanum chasis
* elimnated "triples" due to the size and complexity to power
* completed building strafer chasis we won in a raffel

**Blocking:**
* waiting on parts
* REV expansion hub out of stock


# 21-09-26  

**Members Present:** Govind, Sava

**Notes:**
* tested strafer chasis - clearance to low
* completed lifted chasis - discovered that because of the motors being mounted horizontally the robot has to be super wide
* looking into mounting motors vertically

**Blocking:**
* REV Expansion hub out of stock

# 2021-10-10

**Members Present:** Sava, Govind, Aadi, Alisha, Amulya, Rishi, Rishab

**Notes:**
* Decided that intake will not pull blocks into robot. It will instead slide them along floor into basket.
* Viper slide will need to reach ground level. (need extension arm)
* Assigned tasks for the week (Sava, Govind - prototype intake in cad,  Aadi create mount plate for REV control hubs and battery,  Amulya, Aadi, Aarya - Assemble lifted chasis V2 fom CAD)

**Blocking:**
* For intake will need parts to build
* need to take a part old lifted chasis for parts


# 2021-10-17

**Members Present:** Sava, Govind, Aadi, , Amulya, Rishi Rishab

**Notes:**
* Completed building new lifted chasis (need to test)
* Decided to put a secondary set of horizontal wheels in the intake to help guide the game elements.
* Discovered that their is a significant size different between game elements, so we will have to mount the front rollers of the intake on shocks

**Blocking:**
* For intake will need parts to build
* REV expansion hub still not in stock (If it doesn't restock we will either have to borrow one or only use 4 motors)

# 2021-10-18

**Members Present:** Sava, Govind

**Notes:**
* We decided that we will purchase the Gobilda viper slide
* The slide will allow us to simplify our design and use less custom parts
* On the end of the slide we want to put a half claw (this will allow us to put parts on the shipping hub as well as place our custom shipping element)

**Blocking:**
* Waiting on intake parts
* REV expansion hub still not in stock (If it doesn't restock we will either have to borrow one or only use 4 motors)

# 2021-10-21

**Members Present:** Sava

**Notes:**
* Decided that we will need to cut gobild gekko wheel (blocks and balls bounce off)
* Spring loaded design works well (will need tighter springs)
* Decided that our shipping element will be a cube of the same size as the game element cubes (for ease of collection)

**Blocking:**
* Waiting on some intake parts (majority have arrived)
* REV expansion hub still not in stock

# 2021-10-24

**Members Present:** Sava, Aadi, Govind, Rishab, Alisha, Rishab, Aarya

**Notes:**
* We discovered that the wheel intake does not work very well
* We will be building two new types of rollers, one with rubber bands and one with noodles
* We will still use Gobilda Gekko wheels for the second set of rollers (we will cut them to allow more flexibility)

**Blocking:**
* Waiting on new intake parts
* REV expansion hub still not in stock (emailed REV)

# 2021-11-5

**Members Present:** Sava

**Notes:**
* We found that the edges of the rubber band roller can clip the game elements resulting in the roller snapping
* Redesigning roller so that rubber bands are on the outside (no way for plastic roller to touch game elements)
* Decided to desgin our own lift system with basket (no viper slide)

**Blocking:**
* Waiting for new parts to assemble a linear slide

# 2021-11-14

**Members Present:** Sava

**Notes:**
* We tested our robot on the complete areana and discovered that it can get stuck on the blockers
* We are going to put bigger wheels because the edge of the gobilda c-channel clips the blockers when we hit them at an angle
* For the lift we have designed a temporary one for the upcoming scrimages (it mounted similarly to how the viper slide wil be but canot extend, and thus not reach the top of the shipping hub)
* For the scrimmage we are adding two extra omni wheels on either side of the robot to help it cross the blocker

**Blocking:**
* Waiting for new parts to assemble a linear slide

# 2021-11-20

**Members Present:** Sava, Govind, Aarya, Alisha, Aadi, Amulya

**Notes:**
* We tested our robot at a scrimage
* Robot does not have enough clearance and can get stuck
* Lift system with servos perfomerd well
* When going over the blockers cage sometimes could not hold game element
* Our robot was a 1/4 of an inch to big
* Need to make sideplates and follow rules about labeling
* Overall, great performance but could be better
* Going forward we are going to make our robot skinnier so we can go around the blockers

**Blocking:**
* Begining to redesign robot

# 2021-11-23

**Members Present:** Sava, Aadi, Amulya, Rishi, Rishab

**Notes:**
* We decided to make the robot able to go qround the blockers but also over if neccesary
* Create a flipping intake that limits the robot to only one game element at a time
* Simplify lift mechanism to just one swinging arm - no need for slide
* Redesign game elment basket so it has a ramp to increase robot's reach

**Blocking:**
* Waiting on parts for redesign

# 2021-11-26

**Members Present:** Sava, Aadi, Amulya, Govind

**Notes:**
* For the flipping intake we decided to mount the motor on the back of the rotating cage
* Use one torque servo to rotate the cage
* Torque servo struggled in preliminary testing with temporary mockup (the motor is too heavy)

**Blocking:**
* nothing

# 2021-11-29

**Members Present:** Sava, Govind, Aarya, Alisha, Aadi, Amulya

**Notes:**
* We decided to move the motor that spins the intake off the basket
* We will use a shaft chain system to power the intake and one servo to rotate it

**Blocking:**
* waiting on new parts

# 2021-12-5

**Members Present:** Govind, Alisha, Aadi, Amulya

**Notes:**
* Robot needs side rollers to be able to go around the blockers smoothly
* Put sheils in C-Channels under the robot so it does not get stuck on blockers
* Cut C-Channels the motors are mounted in so they cannot get stuck on the blocker spikes

**Blocking:**
* waiting 3d printed parts for intake

# 2021-12-10

**Members Present:** Sava, Aarya, Alisha, Aadi

**Notes:**
* We started experimenting with different types of spinners for the intake
* Noodle roller - worked well but was a bit to stiff (worth further testing but more materials needed)
* Rubber band roller - to small of a space for it to be affective
* Foam Board - very affective worked great (We will get materials to make further prototypes)

**Blocking:**
* waiting on parts for lift
* waiting on materials for intake roller
