## **Week 3: Loops, Conditionals, and Color Sensors**
***

**(Arya & Alisha - 10m)** Icebreaker: 4 corners

**(Aadi - 10m)** Last class Recap: 
Group discussion on last class

**(Rishi - 10m)** 
* Why do we need sensors?
* How are sensors used + Why are they needed?
* Types of sensors

**(Amulya - 10m)** Considerations for mounting color sensor on robot:
* Distance from ground 
* Positioning on robot (front? middle?)
* Do’s and Don’ts 

**Challenge:** If sensing black, stand in place, else move forward.

**(Group Lesson)** Explain loops:
* Repeat until
* Forever loops
* If-then-else conditions
* Have them try moving in a square using loops

**Combine loops/conditionals and color sensors:**
* Move in square-like pattern: move straight, turn 90˚ if sensing the color black (Loop forever)

## **Week 2: Basics of Programming**
***

**(Alisha - 10m)** Icebreaker: Rock-paper-scissors game

**(Group Lesson)** Explain the basics of EV3 classroom and how to use it:
* Different categories
* Connecting to the robot
* Doing basic drives and turns

**Challenges:**
* Driving in a square
* Driving in a circle
* Driving in larger or smaller circles

**(Group Activity)**: 
* Have groups write a program to drive forward until it reaches a line
* Make them run the program 10 times and record data (How many times it was on target, how many times off and by how much)
* Get them thinking for next time about why the robot was not always consistent

## **Week 1: Introduction and Building a Robot**
***

* Collected checks from most parents
* Introduced ourselves and formed the groups

**Icebreaker:** Have each group work together to come up with a team name, and share how and why they chose that name

**Introduction:**
* What kinds of things they'll learn in the program
* Show them how to find EV3 robot instructions

**(Group Activity)** Follow the instructions to build a basic robot, which involves working as a team and getting to know each other.

**Challenge along the way:** Improvise by finding a way to support the robot since there are no more ball bearings

**If there's extra time:**
* Use our laptop to get the robot moving
* Test it on the FLL table
