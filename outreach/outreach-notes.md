## **Week 5: Getting Started on a Mission**
***

**Icebreaker:** Alisha
* Organize by birthday

**Introduction:**
* Recap: Last week we worked with color and ultrasonic sensors, went through each mission and you all chose 3 missions to do
* Agenda: Mission Strategy, decide which 1 mission to fully attempt
* Think about: Do you need color sensors? Do you need attachments? - can you push something with your robot itself?

**Materials:**
* Cargo Connect Mat - print sheets and put in sheet protectors
* 5 robots, 5 color sensors, and cables
* Tiles to put mat on
* 2 FLL mats and mission modes
* Paper and pencils
* Expo markers

**Setup:**
One table and one-floor mat
5 tables for teams to work on

**Today’s description:**
To start off, the teams should decide on 1 mission to work on. They should brainstorm more ideas and plan their design on paper before starting. Team leads make sure they have an actual plan to avoid confusion. Then, start by navigating from launch to the mission, complete the mission, and navigate to home. DO NOT HAVE THEM COMBINE MISSIONS  or even start a second mission. The main focus is for them to try and complete an individual mission.

Optional:
Use color sensors for navigation.

## **Week 4: Color Sensors (cont'd), Ultrasonic Sensors, and FLL Missions Intro**
***

Icebreaker: Alisha
Musical Chairs

**IMPORTANT:**
Q&A for sensors: Rishi
What are the different sensors?
Why do we use sensors?

**Groups:**
Group A: 2 teams, Arya + Rishabh
Group B: 2 teams, Alisha + Aadi
Group C: 1 team (the 3rd graders), Amulya

Each rotation lasts for 30-35 minutes

**Rotation 1:**
Group A at Missions
Group B at Color Sensors
Group C at Ultrasonic

**Rotation 2:**
Group C at Missions
Group A at Color Sensors
Group B at Ultrasonic Sensors

**Rotation 3:**
Group B at Missions
Group C at Color Sensors
Group A at Ultrasonic

Missions description:
Group leads walk the teams through the missions, the teams come up with ideas to solve missions. Leads should guide teams to the right missions for their level. Leads and teams choose three missions they would like to attempt. Draw out plans on a paper for attachments and general mission strategy.

Color Sensors description:
Help the group mount 2 color sensors in front of the robot, explain the distance between the sensor and floor.
Challenge 1:
Align robot with line: Figure 1
Explain essence of alignment with line: move both motors, if a color sensor senses black, stop the motor corresponding with that sensor.
Guide team through code-writing process, do not write the code for them
Explain how alignment could be useful in missions 
Challenge 2:
	Zig-zag line follow: Figure 2
Use two long strips of yellow and red paper, red to the right of yellow. If sensing red, move to the left, and if sensing yellow, move to the right.



Ultrasonic Sensors description:
Help group mount 1 ultrasonic sensor in the front of the robot. Explain what an ultrasonic sensor measures, and depending on the age of the group, explain how an ultrasonic sensor works.
Challenge 1: Figure 3
Stop & Go: Move forward. If sensor senses an object less than 3 cm away from it, stop the robot
Play with code, move wall up and down and see how robot reacts
Challenge 2: Figure 4
Use 4 boards as shown and reuse part of the code from the previous challenge: Move forward. If the distance from the robot to a board is less than 3 cm, turn 90º clockwise, keep moving forward. The robot should move in a rectangular pattern

## **Week 3: Loops, Conditionals, and Color Sensors**
***

**(Arya & Alisha - 10m)** Icebreaker: 4 corners

**(Aadi - 10m)** Last class Recap: 
Group discussion on last class

**(Rishi - 10m)** 
* Why do we need sensors?
* How are sensors used + Why are they needed?
* Types of sensors

**(Amulya - 10m)** Considerations for mounting color sensor on robot:
* Distance from ground 
* Positioning on robot (front? middle?)
* Do’s and Don’ts 

**Challenge:** If sensing black, stand in place, else move forward.

**(Group Lesson)** Explain loops:
* Repeat until
* Forever loops
* If-then-else conditions
* Have them try moving in a square using loops

**Combine loops/conditionals and color sensors:**
* Move in square-like pattern: move straight, turn 90˚ if sensing the color black (Loop forever)

## **Week 2: Basics of Programming**
***

**(Alisha - 10m)** Icebreaker: Rock-paper-scissors game

**(Group Lesson)** Explain the basics of EV3 classroom and how to use it:
* Different categories
* Connecting to the robot
* Doing basic drives and turns

**Challenges:**
* Driving in a square
* Driving in a circle
* Driving in larger or smaller circles

**(Group Activity)**: 
* Have groups write a program to drive forward until it reaches a line
* Make them run the program 10 times and record data (How many times it was on target, how many times off and by how much)
* Get them thinking for next time about why the robot was not always consistent

## **Week 1: Introduction and Building a Robot**
***

* Collected checks from most parents
* Introduced ourselves and formed the groups

**Icebreaker:** Have each group work together to come up with a team name, and share how and why they chose that name

**Introduction:**
* What kinds of things they'll learn in the program
* Show them how to find EV3 robot instructions

**(Group Activity)** Follow the instructions to build a basic robot, which involves working as a team and getting to know each other.

**Challenge along the way:** Improvise by finding a way to support the robot since there are no more ball bearings

**If there's extra time:**
* Use our laptop to get the robot moving
* Test it on the FLL table
